	@abstract
 MUXSDKStats offers an interface for monitoring video players.

	@discussion
 MUXSDKStats monitors an AVPlayer performance by sending tracking pings to Mux servers.

 In the simplest use case, an AVPlayer can be provided to the MUXSDKStats API and everything else is taken care of for you. The MUXSDKStats monitor methods attach a set of timed state and key-value observers on the AVPlayer. When you are done with an AVPlayer instance, call destroyPlayer: to remove the observers.

 If you change the video that is playing in an AVPlayer, you should call videoChangeForPlayer:withVideoData to provide the updated video information. Not calling videoChangeForPlayer:withVideoData when the video changes will cause tracking pings to be associated with the last video that was playing.
