# mux-stats-sdk-avplayer

Mux integration with `AVPlayer` and `AVPlayerLayer` for iOS native applications.

This integration is built on top of [Mux's core Objective-C library](https://github.com/muxinc/stats-sdk-objc), allowing thinner wrappers for each new player, such as any third-party players that do not use (or expose) an underlying `AVPlayer` and/or `AVPlayerLayer`.

## Integration Instructions
Full integration instructions can be found here: https://docs.mux.com/docs/ios-integration-guide.
