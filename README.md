# mux-stats-sdk-avplayer

Mux Data integration for monitoring video performance and QoS for `AVPlayer`, `AVPlayerViewController`, and `AVPlayerLayer` in iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS applications.

This integration is built on top of [Mux's core Objective-C library](https://github.com/muxinc/stats-sdk-objc) for Mux Data monitoring. The core library is intended to be used with third-party players or to implement a completely custom integration.
